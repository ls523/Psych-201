Data of a direct replication study of the description-only condition that was originally published by Hoogeveen, S., Sarafoglou, A., & Wagenmakers, E.-J. (2020). Laypeople Can Predict Which Social-Science Studies Will Be Replicated Successfully. *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 3*(3), 267â€“285. https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245920919667. 
The replication study, for which the data is provided here, was conducted by Manuel Rausch (Contact: manuel.rausch@ku.de). 
No IRB approval was obtained for this study.

### Summary

The study investigated the extent to which a finding's replication success can be predicted by its intuitive plausibility. Non-experts predicted the replication success of 27 high-profile social-science findings based on short descriptions of the research question, study design, results, and conclusion. They also reported their degree of confidence that the study would replicte. The replication study replicated the original finding by Hoogeveen et al. that laypeople are able to predict which studies will replicate or not.
