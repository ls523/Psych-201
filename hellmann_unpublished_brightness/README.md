This was a perceptual discrimination experiment, in which participants saw two dics with different brightness on a black screen. The brightness of both discs varied from frame to frame but had a constant mean, which was manipulated. Participants had to indicate whether the brighter disc was on the left or on the right (as fast and accurately as possible), by pressing the respective arrow key on the keyboard using one hand. After the decision, they indicated their confidence in the decision on a vertical visual analogue scale using a Joystick. Confidence values range from -1 to 1.
After the confidence report, an error-feedback in the form of the word "Fehler" (German for "Error") for one second, if their discrimination choice was incorrect. 

Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee at The University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt (no. 151 - 2023).

Data was previously presented at the 56th Annual Meeting of the Society for Mathematical Psychology (MathPsych) in Amsterdam in 2023 (Experiment 2; see https://osf.io/gvtf2 for the presentation).
